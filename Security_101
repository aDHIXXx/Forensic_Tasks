Security 101
This one was a awesome....phew
So first one has to unzip Security_101.zip
It now gives us a my_inspiration.jpg and another zip file my_secure_file.zip
But my_secure-file.zip is password protected. 
THe clue to crack it is given in the question "Nerd : Some people keep their username as password. Why would they do that ? Me : Hmm ..." .
So I exiftooled the my_inspirationa.jpg ---> CMD: exiftool my_inspiration.jpg
And luckily after a whole day, the bell finally rang in my head that username can be the creator of the jpg ----> Creator:R3DDIT_US3R 
I used R3DDIT_US3R as the password to unzip the my_secure_file.zip and it WORKED!!
It opened up to give secure.jpg which had the flag :inctfj{1ts_4ll_f1ne_tru5t_m3}
